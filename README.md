> Hedera Token Service hackathon project

## Motivation
The typical online checkout process involves multiple inputs and interactions. We wanted to remove all of the friction and pair our lightening quick purchasing experience with a 'native' payment token that offers near real-time finality. **Genuine _Instant Purchases_ are now a thing!**

## User Stories

## Why?
*The term "finality of payment" refers to the moment at which funds, recently transferred from one account to another, officially become the legal property of the receiving party.*

When people transact, they want to be confident that once their transactions go through, that the transactions cannot be arbitrarily changed or reversed.

> Hedera Token Service hackathon project

## Motivation
The typical online checkout process involves multiple inputs and interactions. We wanted to remove all of the friction and pair our lightening quick purchasing experience with a 'native' payment token that offers near real-time finality. **Genuine _Instant Purchases_ are now a thing!**

## User Stories

## Why?
The term *"finality of payment"* refers to the moment at which funds, recently transferred from one account to another, officially become the legal property of the receiving party.

*Finality* is important because when people transact they want to be confident that once their transactions go through they cannot be altered or reversed.

Hedera enables the transactions on our DRGZ marketplace to reach finality in 3 to 5 seconds!
